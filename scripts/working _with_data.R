#challenge 5 : Use the split-apply-combine approach to make a data.frame that counts the total number of animals of each sex caught on each day in the surveys data.
surveys %>%

#challenge 6 : Now use the data.frame you just made to plot the daily number of animals of each sex caught over time. 
#Itâ€™s up to you what geom to use, but a line plot might be a good choice. You should also think about how to differentiate which data corresponds to which sex.
